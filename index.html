  <h1>Better Rules.</h1>

<p>
  Better Rules is a multidisciplinary approach that seeks to simultaneously address a number of facets in the developing of policy and rules.
  They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>creating rules and policy that are both implementable, comprehendable and meet the policy intent,</li>
      <li>comprehending the complexity of the existing legislative space,</li>
      <li>intentionally ensuring rules are implementable on computers where appropriate,</li>
      <li>making rules the digitally consumable component that is required by the concept of Government as a platform</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
  This resource is focused on documenting the Better Rules practice as it's been developed to date.

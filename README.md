# Better Rules

Better Rules is a multidisciplinary approach that seeks to simultaneously address a number of facets in the developing of policy and rules.
They are:
* creating rules and policy that are both implementable, comprehendable and meet the policy intent,
* comprehending the complexity of the existing legislative space,
* intentionally ensuring rules are implementable on computers where appropriate,
* making rules the digitally consumable component that is required by the concept of Government as a platform

This resource is focused on documenting the Better Rules practice as it's been developed to date.
